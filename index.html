          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>You can change the font size in each section.</li>
          <li>HTML  is used to create web pages.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a "link" element placed in the HTML's "head".</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is at work.</li>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>whereas the style.css file is linked within the "head" element, the script.js file is linked within the "body" element.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy.</li>
